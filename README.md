## Propose PR for new Project

All new projects need to first submit a PR adding their project to the resources page.

### Objective principles
- Has website
- Has shipped code
- Isn't a rug
- Isn't deeply offensive
- Has active usage
- Has an active team/builders

### Subjective and decentralized principles
- Loot Alliance voting mechanism
- Community input
- Lootwatcher votes
- LootProject retweets as tacit votes
- Canon
